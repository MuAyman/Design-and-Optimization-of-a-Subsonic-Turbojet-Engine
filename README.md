# Design of Ramjet Rocket Engine
 
The design of a turbojet engine meets the thrust requirements, mentioned in the attached image, for all mission segments (takeoff, climb, and cruise) for a subsonic transport aircraft. I select the engine design parameters and size that maximize the aircraft range using the simplified method analysis. Results contain representative figures of the engine performance at each segment and comparisons between different scenarios are included. Comparisons between the optimal engine for the cruise and the optimal engine for the overall mission are plotted.
